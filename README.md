- 👋 Hi, I’m @nickolauzan
- 👀 I’m interested in optimization in all its forms, to reduce time, money and be as efficient as possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Power BI for Business, still specializing in graphic design, marketing and sales. Also as a WEB Programmer I continue to acquire knowledge about new technologies and their implementation.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on a young project that allows me to grow as a professional, letting me help in multiple areas and learn from other passionate workers.
